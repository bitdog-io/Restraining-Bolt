# restraining-bolt
Arduino software to monitor and restrain ArduPilot drones. This code uses MAVLink protocol from ArduPilot to determine if the drone is progressing towards waypoints in automated flight.
If its detected that progress isn't being made in the correct direction, a GPIO signal will kill the power and signal a warning.
