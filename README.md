This softare enables Teensy 4.1 microcontrollers to become simple compainion computers 
for ArduPilot based rovers. It integrates with ArduPilot via MAVLink protocol over 
serial telemetry to determine if the connected rover is progressing towards waypoints 
while in automated flight. If the software detects that progress isn't being made in 
the direction of the target waypoint, a signal will be provide on a GPIO pin.
